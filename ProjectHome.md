Takes a rotated image and rotates it back to an upright position.  It estimates the rotation angle of an image (e.g. voting ballot) by using a Hough transform to find near-vertical/near-horizontal lines and then undoes the rotation.

The tool is intended to be well-suited for straightening, for example, scans of ballots, forms, and other documents with several vertical or horizontal lines. The tool is not likely to be useful for processing random photographs and other arbitrary images.
